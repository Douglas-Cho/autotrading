# autotrading

Placeholder for automatic trading bots code samples. I hope this helps build your own autotrading platforms using the APIs. 

- IbPy_DKC.py:

Code snippets from my trading bots using APIs for Interactive Brokers LLC. (http://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/#gsc.tab=0). The code will show your portfolio status and exit. This requires IbWrapper package from Mr Anthony Ng (https://github.com/anthonyng2/ib).

- CFTC.xlsm:

A VBA bot that downlods "Commitments of Traders" from US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's website (https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm) and show the net changes in Leveraged Funds' positions. 

- eBest_Classes_Sample.py:

Another code snippets from my trading bots using APIs for eBest Securities Co. (a Korean securities company http://www.ebestsec.co.kr/). The file shows some basic query functions.
